## Setup for complete novices

You'll need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Check for updates in Rust and Cargo in the terminal. 

```
rustup update
```
AND

```
cargo update
```
You also need to grab [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) or
[GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

Check if the softwares have been properly installed by using the following:

```
software_name_like_chromedriver --version
```

## Download Github Desktop and a text editor

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

You also need a good text editor. I used this one:

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Other useful installs**

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

For assistance, try using a ChatGPT for help in walking you through how to install.
