##Setup

You'll need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Check for updates in Rust and Cargo in the terminal. 

```
rustup update
```
AND

```
cargo update
```
You also need to grab [ChromeDriver] (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) or
[GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

Find the version of ChromeDriver that matches your Google Chrome version and download it to install.
